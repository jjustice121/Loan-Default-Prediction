# Loan Default Prediction:
# Background
Aggregate consumer debt has been increasing steadily since the 2008-09 financial crisis, According to US Bank, total household debt reached a record 17.94 trillion dollars in 2024 posing a potential macroeconomic threat, as household debt increases we would expect to see consumption weaken and a heightened risk of recession. It is within this macroeconomic context that we should consider the importance of supporting consumer credit risk modeling and therefore probability of default (PD) modeling.
